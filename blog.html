        <h2 class="text-primary">Difference between var let and const in javascript</h2>
        <h3>Var</h3>
        <p class="text-body-emphasis">A lot of shiny new features came out with ES2015 (ES6). And now, since it's 2020, it's assumed that a lot of JavaScript developers have become familiar with and have started using these features. While this assumption might be partially true, it's still possible that some of these features remain a mystery to some devs. One of the features that came with ES6 is the addition of let and const, which can be used for variable declaration. The question is, what makes them different from good ol' var which we've been using? If you are still not clear about this, then this article is for you. In this article, we'll discuss var, let and const  with respect to their scope, use, and hoisting. As you read, take note of the differences between them that I'll point out.<br>
            Var Before the advent of ES6, var declarations ruled. There are issues associated with variables declared with var, though. That is why it was necessary for new ways to declare variables to emerge. First, let's get to understand var more before we discuss those issues.<br>
        </p>
        <h3>Let</h3>
        <p class="text-body-emphasis">
            
            let is now preferred for variable declaration. It's no surprise as it comes as an improvement to var declarations. It also solves the problem with var that we just covered. Let's consider why this is so.<br>
            Variables declared with the const maintain constant values. const declarations share some similarities with let declarations.
        </p>
        <h3>Constant</h3>
        <p class="text-body-emphasis">Like let declarations, const declarations can only be accessed within the block they were declared.</p>

        <h2 class="text-primary">Difference between regular function and arrow function</h2>
        <p class="text-body-emphasis">In JavaScript, there are two main ways of writing functions. You can create functions using the regular function syntax. Or you can use the arrow function syntax. In this article, you will learn how to use both options. You'll also learn about the differences between the two and when it's appropriate to use each of them.<br>
        To understand the difference between the two options, let's begin by looking at their syntax. To return a value from a regular function, you have to explicitly use the return keyword. Otherwise the function will return undefined.JavaScript provides a way to access all arguments passed to a function. But the way you acess these arguments depends on the type of function you are working with.</p>

        <h2 class="text-primary">Javascript map function</h2>
        <p class="text-body-emphasis">Description:<br>
            map() creates a new array from calling a function for every array element.
            
            map() does not execute the function for empty elements.
            
            map() does not change the original array.<br>
            Syntax<br>
            array.map(function(currentValue, index, arr), thisValue)</p>

        <h2 class="text-primary">Javascript foreach function</h2>
        <p class="text-body-emphasis">Description:<br>
            The forEach() method calls a function for each element in an array.
            
            The forEach() method is not executed for empty elements.<br>
            Syntax<br>

        <h2 class="text-primary">Javascript filter function</h2>
        <p class="text-body-emphasis">Description:<br>
            The filter() method creates a new array filled with elements that pass a test provided by a function.
            
            The filter() method does not execute the function for empty elements.
            
            The filter() method does not change the original array.</p>

        <h2 class="text-primary">Javascript find function</h2>
        <p class="text-body-emphasis">Description:<br>
            The find() method returns the value of the first element that passes a test.
            
            The find() method executes a function for each array element.
            
            The find() method returns undefined if no elements are found.
            
            The find() method does not execute the function for empty elements.
            
            The find() method does not change the original array.

        <h2 class="text-primary">Template string in javascript</h2>
        <p class="text-body-emphasis">Template literals are literals delimited with backtick (`) characters, allowing for multi-line strings, string interpolation with embedded expressions, and special constructs called tagged templates.

            Template literals are sometimes informally called template strings, because they are used most commonly for string interpolation (to create strings by doing substitution of placeholders). However, a tagged template literal may not result in a string; it can be used with a custom tag function to perform whatever operations you want on the different parts of the template literal.</p>
